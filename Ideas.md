# Ideas

Here are some ideas for our project. Feel free to add new ones!

1. Count the number of stations per km2 for each country
2. % of time when each of the stations was active (sometimes there is missing data in *Concentration*, *Validity = 0* or just missing *.csv*)
3. Find dates when the concentration of a pollutant exceeded the maximum permissible concentration, if possible, find reasons for those events
4. Find countries with the best and the worst ecological situation (e. g. simply with the lowest average concentration but also take variance into account)
