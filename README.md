# Title: TO DO

# Abstract
When we breathe polluted air pollutants get into our lungs; they can enter the bloodstream and be carried to our internal organs such as the brain. This can cause severe health problems such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and even cancer and reduces the quality and number of years of life.

Thus, we feel it is our responsability to limit and even reverse the level of pollutants. In order to achive such a thing we first need to understand what is causing them. Then we need to build proper visualisation to send our results to the general public and make an impact.

# Research questions
How do pollutants levels change throughout the year?

The link between pollutants levels and different external factors (number of cars in cities, geographical position, apparitions of factories..etc)

Cluster cities with different pollution levels ~ analyze what are their common aspects.

# Dataset


The main dataset lists [AirQuality indexes](http://discomap.eea.europa.eu/map/fme/AirQualityExport.htm) for different European cities throughout the time (2013 - 2019). The granularisation is at the city level, approximatively 1 reading being done per day. The pollutants included are CO, NO, NO2, PB, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, THC ...

Not all cities have data for all the years and all pollutants.

We are going to use one ore more extra datasets that can provide us with different insights about some characteristics of the cities (number of inhabitants, cars ...): [European Cities Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/europe-datasets)

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

1. Build crawler for downloading the dataset
2. Analyze the data, visualize it, see what insights we can get from it
3. Split the areas we can focus on, start working individually on those
4. Re-group, discuss the results
5. Work on visualizing the results
6. Combine everything into a report (with conclusion ~ what we can do do limit the effects of pollutants & provide a better future)
